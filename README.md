# Evaluating acidotropic dyes for detecting mixotrophy in protists: insights from cultures and field communities

## Project Background
Mixotrophic organisms, those that can employ both phagotrophy and photosynthesis, are important for nutrient cycling and the microbial food web. Unfortunately, these organisms are difficult to detect in the natural environment. This study evaluated a tool for measuring mixotrophs in aquatic environments: acidotropic dyes. These dyes are thought to bind to acidic digestion vacuoles and can be identified using flow cytometry. We test these dyes in a suite of laboratory organisms and then compare them in the field alongside another tool for measuring mixotrophs: fluorescently labeled particle uptake incubations.

This repository contains data and code used in the analysis of this project. 
## Data
All raw and processed dataframes used in this analysis are hosted in the folder [Data](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/tree/main/Data)

Raw data of culture staining with acidotropic dyes can be found in [CultureLysoData.xlsx](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/CultureLysoData.xlsx). This file has tabs for LysoTracker, LysoSensor, and Fluorescence. LysoTracker & LysoSensor staining data were used for Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 2. Fluorescence data were used for Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 4. Table 1, detailing the culture conditions, was created using the dataset available at [this](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/Table1.xlsx) location. Data for staining with acidotropic dyes during various growth phases, as in Supplemental Figure 1, can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/StainingGrowthPhases.xlsx).

The station data for the field samples can be found at [StationData.xlsx](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/StationData.xlsx), which was used to make Figure 1. Raw flow cytometry data for both cruises can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/20241205_NESLysoTrackerRaw.xlsx) for NES and [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/20241203_CCSLysoTrackerRaw.xlsx) for CCS. This data was then processed; the processed form of these data can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/20241205_NESLysoTrackerProcessed.csv) for NES and [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/20241203_CCSLysoTrackerProcessed.csv) for CCS. A combined datasheet with all field LysoTracker data can be found at [AllCruiseLysoTracker.csv](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/AllCruiseLysoTracker.csv). This dataset was used to make Figure 4.

Similarly, FLP incubations had both raw and processed data. The NES had both microscopy and flow cytometry FLP analysis, found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/NES_FLP_Microscopy.xlsx) and [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/NES_FLP_FCM.xlsx) respectively. These were processed to make [NES_FLP_Processed.csv](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/NES_FLP_Processed.csv). For prey type comparisons on the NES (Supplemental Figure 6), the file [NES_FLP_FCM](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/NES_FLP_FCM.xlsx) was used. Only microscopy was available for the CCS FLP analysis. Raw data can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/CCSRawFLP.xlsx) and processed data [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/CCS_FLP_Processed.csv). All FLP data was combined into the file [AllFLPData.xlsx](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/AllFLPData.xlsx). For grazing calculations, bacteria concentrations were needed. NES specific data can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/NESBacteria.xlsx), and all bacteria data can be found at [BacteriaConcentrations.xlsx](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/BacteriaConcentrations.xlsx). FLP and LysoTracker data together were used to make Figure 5 and Supplemental Figures 9, 10, and 11, along with images that can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16813439). 

Flow cytometer settings as reported in Supplemental Table 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/FlowCytometerInfo.xlsx). 

For the CCS transect, RNA data and incubation experiments were also conducted. The RNA taxonomy information can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/CubiTaxa.xlsx) for the incubation experiment and [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/station_protist_taxonomy.csv) for the stations. Nutrient and community data for the incubation experiment can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/CCSIncubations.xlsx). These data were used to make Figure 6 and Supplemental Figures 12 and 13. Percent of reads that were mapped and annotated can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/PUPCYCLE_Reads_Stats.xlsx), which was used to make Supplemental Figure 8.

Finally, the data necessary for Supplemental Figures 3 and 4 relating to grazing on the two cruises can be found [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/SupplementalGrazing.xlsx) with tabs for both Tetraselmis spp. and the Southern Ocean mixotrophs, with the z-stack image in Supplemental Figure 3 [here](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Data/TetraZStack-1.png)
## R Scripts
Various R scripts were created within an R project to process data, generate Figures, and perform statistical analyses. 

Maps of each cruise transect seen in Figure 1 were made using [Maps.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/Maps.R)

Tables 1 and Supplemental Tables 1, 2, and 3 were created using [Tables.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/Tables.R)

Acidotropic dye staining of cultures seen in Figure 2 was made using [LysoBarPlot.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/LysoBarPlot.R). Staining during different growth phases, as seen in Supplemental Figure 1, is plotted in [GrowthPhaseStaining.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/GrowthPhaseStaining.R).

Fluorescence data seen in Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 4 were made using [FluorescenceTable.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/FluoresenceTable.R)

FLP data was processed using [FLPDataWrangling.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/FLPDataWrangling.R), and LysoTracker data was processed for the CCS cruise using [CCS_LysoTrackerProcess.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/CCS_LysoTrackerProcess.R) and for the NES cruise [NES_LysoTracker_Process.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/NES_LysoTracker_Process.R). 

Community composition on each cruise, seen in Figure 4 was plotted using [CommunityDepth.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/CommunityDepth.R) with statistics run in [CruiseCommunityStats.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/CruiseCommunityStats.R). 

Mixotroph proportions, concentrations, and grazing on both cruises found in Figures 5 and Supplemental Figures 9, 10, and 11 were plotted using [MixotrophGraphs.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/MixotrophGraphs.R). Significant differences were calculated in the file [FLPStatistics.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/FLPStatistics.R). 

CCS incubation experiments and RNA data for the CCS cruise, seen in Figures 6, Supplemental Figure 12, and Supplemental Figure 13, were plotted using [CCSIncubations_RNA.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/CCSIncubations_RNA.R). Percent of reads mapped and annotated (Supplemental Figure 8) was analyzed using [ReadStats.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/ReadStats.R).


Finally, Supplemental grazing data for the mixotrophs (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4) was plotted using [SupplementalGrazing.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/SupplementalGrazing.R), and prey type comparisons on the NES cruise (Supplemental Figure 6) were plotted using [NES_preycomparisons.R](https://github.com/CohenLabUGA/AcidotropicDyes/blob/main/Code/NES_preycomparisons.R).
