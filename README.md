## Project Background
Mixotrophic organisms, those that can employ both phagotrophy and photosynthesis, are extremely important for nutrient cycling and the microbial food web. Unfortunately, these organisms are difficult to detect in the natural environment. This study evaluated a tool for measuring mixotrophs in aquatic environments, acidotropic dyes. These dyes are thought to bind to acidic digestion vacuoles and can be identified using flow cytometry. We test these dyes in a suite of lab organisms and then compare them in the field to the community standard for measuring mixotrophs, fluorescently labeled particle incubations.
